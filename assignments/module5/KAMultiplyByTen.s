# 4 - Read an input number and using left logical shifts and add instructions  
# multiply that number by 10 and print out the result.
# * (Extra Credit 5 points) - In a normal swap a temporary variable is needed,
# eg "r2 = r0; r0 = r1; r1 = r2; " swaps r0 and r1.  A swap can be implemented without the temporary
# r2 register using xor operations (the eor instruction). 
# Write a program to swap two registers using eor instructions.
